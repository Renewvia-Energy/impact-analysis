\section*{Data Availability Statement}
In line with our commitment to transparency and scientific reproducibility, the anonymized responses from the surveys conducted for this study are released alongside the publication of this paper. We have ensured that all personally identifiable information has been removed from these responses to maintain the confidentiality and privacy of the participants. \textcolor{purple}{Per the request of the communities, this includes redacting the names and precise locations of the communities involved, replacing them with the state in which each community resides (e.g, ``Cross River 1,'' ``Turkana 2,'' etc.). This measure is crucial to protect the identity of the communities while still providing context and geographical relevance to the data.} This anonymization process was undertaken with great care to preserve the integrity and utility of the data for further analysis and research.

Researchers and interested parties can access these datasets to validate our findings, conduct further analysis, or for comparative studies in similar fields. The data is available in CSV format.

By providing open access to our research data, we aim to foster a collaborative and transparent research environment that encourages knowledge sharing and collective advancement in our field.
